## To Do

- capturing scope (by value/reference) when defining functions
- pointers (perhaps define whole new language for this)
- show instances for grammar (or use Pretty clas?)
- better type and execution errors e.g. line numbers and better messages (redue
  the amount of abstraction for errors and stuff i.e. give message in place for
  each error)
